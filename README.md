## Welcome to my Capstone Project!

During my 4-weeks project I am going to built an App called "Do I? I Do!" ðŸŒº

**Do I? I Do!** is a wedding planner app to make planning a little easier for all future bridal couples. <br>
It is possible to enter some important facts on the home page to have an overview of the big day. Below you will see self created To Dos that you will need to take care of over time. Furthermore, you are able to create a guest list to not lose track of all your loved ones and you can also save your total budget so you know what you have already spent and how much of your budget is still left.
