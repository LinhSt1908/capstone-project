## Welcome to my Capstone Project!

During my 4-weeks project I built an App called "Do I? I Do!" ðŸŒº

**Do I? I Do!** is a wedding planner app to make planning a little easier for all bridal couples. <br>
It will be possible to enter some important facts on the home page to have an overview of the big day. Below you will see a few self created milestones that you will need to take care of over time. Furthermore, you will be able to create a guest list to not lose track of all your loved ones. You will also save your total budget so you know what you have already spent and how much of your budget is still left. <br>
(To make the app playful and inspiring, you can take a look at how wedding attires around the world look like in the last category and test your knowledge with a little quiz --> this category is only optional for now)
