## Welcome to my Capstone Project!

During my 4-weeks project I built an App called "Do I? I Do!" ðŸŒº

**Do I? I Do!** is a wedding planner app to make planning a little easier for all bridal couples. <br>
So far it is possible to enter some important facts on the home page to have an overview of the big day. Below you can see a few milestones that you will need to take care of over time. Furthermore, you can create a guest list to not lose track of all your loved ones. You can also create your total budget so you know what you have already spent and how much of your budget is still left. <br>
(To make the app playful and inspiring, you can take a look at how wedding attires around the world look like in the last category and test knowledge with a little quiz --> this category is only optional for now)
